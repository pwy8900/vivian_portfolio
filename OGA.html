            <h2 class="subtitle">Abstract</h2>
            <p>While the UW Office of Global Affairs (OGA) relies on the Global Publications Dashboard to showcase UW faculty’s 
            scholarship and worldwide collaborations, its user retention has decreased since the data source became outdated in 2019.
            Some users couldn’t find the desired information, such as statistics regarding the department’s global presence and 
            international co-authorship. Additionally, some faculties’ work has not been acknowledged.</p>
            
            <p>
            To address this issue, we retrieved 2 million rows of up-to-date data, improved the name-matching process, 
            added indexing to increase database performance, and developed a networking tool to empower UW faculties to 
            enhance global engagement and facilitate research collaboration.
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The UW Office of Global Affairs (OGA) relies on the Global Publications Dashboard to 
                showcase UW faculty publications and co-authorships. While this tool is important for 
                demonstrating the influence of UW faculty and alumni on academic publications worldwide, 
                its user retention has decreased since the data source became outdated in 2019. Our project aims 
                to update the dashboard with current data from the OpenAlex API and enhance the website's functionality 
                with user-centered features.
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Target Stakeholders</h2>
            <p>
                Stakeholders can access the Rosetta website through OGA's website. 
                They will be able to view the dashboard to get an understanding of UW's publications and co-authorships 
                around the world. However, since our website mainly serves UW faculties, users will need to log in with 
                their UW credentials in order to utilize advanced features such as the Publications and the Scholars page. 
                This is to maintain data integrity and for the development team to keep track of users' information as we allow 
                users to upload their work. We want to prevent users from claiming publications that don't belong to them and 
                support users from refreshing the database when they manually upload their work.
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Our Solution</h2>
            <h3 class="solution">Refreshed Data Dashboard</h3>
                <p>
                    Since Microsoft Academic Graph stopped providing services, OGA decided to switch to OpenAlex as a new data 
                    source. We wrote a Python script to call on OpenAlex API and extracted 2M rows of updated publications data. 
                    The output dataset is published to OGA's MySQL server after going through another name-matching process 
                    with the UW HR database to facilitate data management and workflow at the production level. 
                    Therefore, we are able to visualize the global impact of the university by publishing a Tableau dashboard 
                    connected to the MySQL database.
                </p>
            <h3 class="solution">Networking Tool</h3>
                <p>
                    After having stakeholder interviews and user testings, we noticed that our stakeholders, 
                    UW faculties, are interested in the percentile of UW's relationship with other institutions 
                    as well as connecting with scholars whose publications they are interested in. Hence, we developed a 
                    networking tool where users can browse scholars' profiles and reach out to others via email. 
                    They can also bookmark publications that they want to come back to later and find these publications under 
                    their profile page. We also encourage scholars to manually upload their publications to help 
                    refresh our database.
